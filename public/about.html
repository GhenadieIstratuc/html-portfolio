<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Sun in Scorpio</h2>
<p>Scorpios are known for their intensity. They are determined folk who absolutely throw themselves into whatever they do, but getting them to commit to something is rarely easy. In fact, it's better not to even try to "get them" to do anything. Solar Scorpios have their own mind. And, their primary motivation is unlikely to be prestige (like their Capricorn friends) or even authority (Leos can have that, too)--it's real power. Their power can be of the "behind the scenes" variety, just as long as they have it.

<h2>Moon in Leo</h2>
<p>This is a warm, creative, and proud position of the Moon. Moon in Leo people want to create and entertain. They love deeply and largely. They can be rather lazy at times and a little bossy too. Generally, though, they have a deep need to treat others fairly and justly.
Lunar Leos require lots and lots of love and care in order to function well in the world. Depending on other positions in the chart, Moon in Leo people aren't always outgoing. When they feel comfortable, they do like being the center of attention. That is, they enjoy being in the "spotlight" in the comfort of their own homes and with family and friends. They love entertaining others and often take on the role of comic or story-teller.

<h2>ASC in Sagittarius</h2>
<p>Sagittarius rising people have opinions about everything, and they just love telling others exactly what they are. Not all people with this position are outgoing folk, but they all have a way of moving about that at least exudes a certain level of confidence. Some might even call them naive or overly optimistic. Even the quiet ones don't shrink from life and from experience. One of the most obvious and endearing traits of Sagittarius rising is their willingness to keep up a sense of humor. Even when they're feeling low, they manage to find humor in life and have fun with whatever they do have. The placement of Sagittarius' ruling planet, Jupiter, will give more clues to how they go about expressing themselves. Jupiter in Capricorn, for example, might give a more sarcastic approach, but underneath there lies an unmistakable hope and spirit for living.
